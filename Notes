DOM - Document object model
MVC - Model View Controller
Imperative Paradigm - You directly change various parts of your app according to user interactions.
Declarative Paradigm - You declare whats the state of our app and React deals with the rendering
One way Data Flow - The state change triggers a change into the DOM

Without arrow function in onClick it will call the console log everytime it renders the page. (click 0, click 1 ... will appear in console.){}

classes vs hooks, specific to react hooks are fairly new and theres no problem with classes.

function test () {
    return (<div> </div>)
}

class test extends Component {
    render() {
        return <div> </div>
    }
}

Order of execution in react 
First the constructor if its a class of course, then it mounts the render then runs ComponentDidMount.
Compenents rerenders when the state and props are changed

JSX uses JS as base, thats why we use className instead of class

if you are going to modify an array, create a new One

When returning a component, make sure to return one parent component 

Be careful with css overlapping styling with different components
